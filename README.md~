###Google Image Search app which allows a user to select search filters and paginate results "infinitely".

###Description:
This app implements Google Image Search, allowing the user to select various search filters and
scroll through results "infinitely" (subject to Google Image Search API limits).

###Hours to complete:
Not tracked.  Worked on over two days with many breaks and interuptions.

###Completed user stories:
* User can enter a search query that will display a grid of image results from the Google Image API.
* User can tap on any image in results to see the image full-screen.
* User can scroll down "infinitely" to continue loading more image results (up to 8 pages - 64 images).
